Description: This package uses the APIs provided by Google's [`Gemini`](https://ai.google.dev/) and OpenAI's [`ChatGPT`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) to allow you to: ask `Gemini` questions and get answers for free; ask `ChatGPT` questions and get answers (not free, charged by ChatGPT); ask `ChatGPT` to convert text to audios (not free, charged by ChatGPT); ask `ChatGPT` to generate transcriptions/subtitles for audios (not free, charged by ChatGPT); ask `ChatGPT` to generate images with texts (not free, charged by ChatGPT). More functionalities will be implemented in the future.
